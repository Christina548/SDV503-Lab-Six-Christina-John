# Refect journal

It was a good experience working with Christina for this pair coding session.

## What have I learnt??

- Working in team.
- Explaination with technical term.
- Working with build in method.
- Working with object and array.
- Taking data structure in mind when writing function.
- There are multiple solutions to one problem.
- It is important to make the code reuseable in the future.
- Working as Github master.

## What is my personal opinion?

- I am so happy to work with Christina as we are both comfortable in switching roles and to work with. The pair coding session proceed quickly as Christina undertand the technical term and a good teammate with awesome listening skills
- I still need research more about Javascript methods in order to ultilise and apply them in practical. Need to understand about what is data structure and how to applying it during coding.
- Really enjoy my second experience as a Github master and why git pull is important when working in team.
